# 📈 LSTM-Based Stock Price Forecasting (RELIANCE.NS)

A deep learning time-series forecasting project that predicts the **next-day closing price** of Reliance Industries using an **LSTM neural network built with PyTorch**.

> 🎓 Developed as a self-learning academic project to gain hands-on experience in real-world machine learning workflows.

---

## 🧠 Project Motivation

As a student exploring **Deep Learning for Time-Series**, this project was created to:

* Understand how stock market data behaves
* Learn how to properly preprocess sequential data
* Implement LSTM using PyTorch
* avoid common mistakes like **data leakage**
* build a complete end-to-end ML pipeline

This project focuses on **learning and implementation**, not financial trading.

## 🤖 Use of ChatGPT

ChatGPT was used as a **learning assistant** for:

* Understanding LSTM concepts
* Debugging implementation errors
* Improving code structure
* Writing clean documentation
* Interpreting model evaluation metrics

All core tasks were performed by me, including:

* Data preprocessing
* Model building
* Training
* Evaluation
* Result visualization

This project reflects my **practical understanding of time-series deep learning**.

## 📊 Dataset

* **Source:** Yahoo Finance
* **Stock:** RELIANCE.NS
* **Duration:** 9 Years
* **Interval:** 1 Day

### Features used:

* Open
* High
* Low
* Close
* Volume

### Target:

Next-day closing price

---

## 🏗️ Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Preprocessing

* Chronological train-test split
* MinMax scaling (fit only on training data)
* No shuffling (time-series aware)

### 2️⃣ Sequence Creation

Transforming time-series into supervised learning format:

```
Previous N days → Next day Close
```

### 3️⃣ Model Development

* Custom PyTorch Dataset & DataLoader
* LSTM architecture
* MSE loss function
* Adam optimizer

### 4️⃣ Evaluation Metrics

* MAE
* RMSE
* R² Score

### 5️⃣ Visualization

* Training loss curve
* Actual vs Predicted prices

---

## 📈 Results

* R² Score: **~0.88 – 0.90**

The high R² is mainly due to **price autocorrelation**, which is expected in
next-day price prediction.

This project demonstrates:

✅ Correct time-series validation
✅ No data leakage
✅ Proper scaling and inverse transformation

---

## ⚠️ Important Note

This model predicts **price movement continuity**, not a trading strategy.

The goal of this project is to showcase:

* Deep learning skills
* Time-series handling
* PyTorch implementation

* PyTorch
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn
* yFinance
